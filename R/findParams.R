#' Function for estimation of probability density function parameters through quadratic optimization
#' 
#' @param p A numeric vector of percentiles.
#'
#' @param q A numeric vector of observed quantiles, might come from a HPD from a previous study (along with a median), or from other sources of prior information. See Details.
#'
#' @param pdfunction A character vector (of length one) with the name of the PDF function of interest. Technically this argument supports any PDF function of the form pDIST (e.g., \code{pnorm}, \code{ppois}, \code{pexp}).
#' 
#' @param params A character vector with the name of the parameter(s) to optimize in the probability density function. These should match the parameter names of the respective PDF function, e.g., \code{"lambda"} in the function \code{ppois}
#'
#' @param initVals A numeric vector with default value \code{NULL}. It allows the user to provide initial values, althought this is discouraged in most cases.
#' 
#' @param output One of two possible values: \code{"complete"} and \code{"parameters"}. For the latter the complete output of the \code{optim} function is returned with information on convergence and squared errors (that might be useless for simple cases) or just the parameters.
#'
#' @return Either a list with the complete output of convergence, squared errors and parameter values, or just a vector of parameter values. Depends on the value of \code{output}.
#' Warnings may be triggered by the function \code{optim} since the optimization is a heuristic process, whenever a given iteration results in an invalid value for a given combination of parameters, the \code{optim} function tries another combination of values but inform the user about the problem through a warning. In general these can be safely disregarded.

#' @details This function comes handy whenever we have some values of uncertainty, (e.g., confidence intervals, HPDs, biostratigraphic age constrains) and want to express it in the form of a probability density function of the form \eqn{P(x;\theta)}. As we have some values (the quantiles) already and their corresponding percentiles, all we need is a way to approximate the parameters \eqn{\theta} that produce the same combination of quantiles for the given percentiles under a given PDF. This is carried out through optimization of a quadratic error function. This is accomplished through the function \code{optim}. For instance, if the estimated age of a fossil is Lutetian, in the Eocene (41.2 to 47.8 Ma), and we want to model such uncertainty through a normal distribution, we could assume that these age boundaries are the quantiles for percentiles 0.025 and 0.975 respectively, and add a thir pair with the midpoint corresponding to the percentile 0.5. This is all the information needed in order to estimate the parameters \code{mean} and \code{sd} in the functiono \code{pnorm}.

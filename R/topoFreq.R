#' Frequency of topologies in a tree sample
#' 
#' @param mphy An object of class multiPhylo
#' @param output A character indicating whether the tree indices or the actual trees should be returned. Defaults to "index"
#' @param maxtrees A numeric indicating whether to warn about having more trees than the arbitrary threshold
#' 
#' @return A list with an element containing the the different tree clusters (as multiPhylo)
#' and the absolute, cumulative, and relative frequencies of each topology in the tree sample.
#'
#' @details This function can be used e.w. with a posterior sample of trees from a bayesian analysis where we
#' want to explore the distribution of topologies in the posterior of trees. This way we can assess topological
#' uncertainty in a more meaningful way than using a majority-rule consensus.
#'
#' The use of `maxtrees` is actually a convenience for keeping in mind that large amounts of trees can cause memory
#' issues. This can end up in situations which are difficult to debug but that from personal experience have come from
#' exactly that: More trees than memory can fit or which can be processed for calculating similarity. This number will _not_
#' break the function call but will return a warning. Try to avoid modifying its default value unless you are sure it will not
#' cause any issues under your computing conditions (e.g. when lots of trees are being processed but also large RAM is available).

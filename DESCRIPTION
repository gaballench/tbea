Description: Functions are provided for prior specification in divergence time
    estimation using fossils as well as other kinds of data. It
    provides tools for interacting with the input and output of Bayesian
    platforms in evolutionary biology such as 'BEAST2', 'MrBayes', 'RevBayes',
    or 'MCMCTree'.
    It Implements a simple measure similarity between probability
    density functions for comparing prior and
    posterior Bayesian densities, as well as code for calculating the
    combination of distributions using conflation of Hill (2008). Functions for estimating the
    origination time in collections of distributions using the x-intercept (e.g., Draper and Smith, 1998) and
    stratigraphic intervals (Marshall 2010) are also available.

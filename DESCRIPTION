Description: Package for bayesian inference in phylogenetics and evolution.
    It provides functions for prior specification in divergence time
    estimation using fossils as well as other kinds of data. The package
    provides tools for interacticng with the input and output of bayesian
    platforms in evolutionary biology such as BEAST2. The package implements
    a way to measure interdependence between probability density functions
    in the context of comparisons between prior and posterior bayesian
    densities. It also provides functions for concatenating molecular and
    morphological data for standard tree estimation (e.g., MrBayes) or total
    evidence FBD divergence time estimation (e.g., Beast or RevBayes).

\title{xintercept: Estimate the x-intercept of an empirical cdf}
\usage{
xintercept(x, method, alpha = 0.05, p = c(0.025, 0.975), R = 1000, robust)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of type numeric with time data points.}

\item{method}{Either "Draper-Smith" or "Bootstrap". The
function will fail otherwise.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of length one and type numeric with
the nominal alpha value for the Draper-Smith method, defaults
to 0.05.}

\item{p}{A vector of length two and type numeric with the
two-tail probability values for the CI. Defaults to 0.025
and 0.975.}

\item{R}{The number of iterations to be used in the Bootstrap
method.}

\item{robust}{Logical value indicating whether to use robust
regression using `Rfit::rfit` (`robust = TRUE`) or ordinary
least squares `lm` (`robust = FALSE`).}
}
\value{
A named list with three elements: `param`, the value
of x_hat; `ci`, the lower and upper values of the confidence
interval on x; `ecdfxy`, the x and y points for the empirical
cumulative density curve.
}
\description{
xintercept: Estimate the x-intercept of an empirical cdf
}
\details{
This function will take a vector of time points, calculate
the empirical cumulative density function, and regress its values
in order to infer the x-intercept and its confidence interval. For
plotting purposes, it will also return the x-y empirical cumulative
density values.

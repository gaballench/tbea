\title{conflate: Calculate the conflation of multiple distributions
pdfs, plot = TRUE, from, to, n, add = FALSE}
\usage{
conflate(pdfs, plot = TRUE, from, to, n, add = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdfs}{A vector of calls to density_fun for defininf each individual distribution.}

\item{plot}{Whether to plot using curve}

\item{from, to, n}{The appropriate values from and to which to calculate the conflation, and a number of points n. These are the same used by the function curve but are still necessary even if no plot is required.}

\item{add}{Whether to add the curve to an existing plot.}

\item{x}{A symbol inside the code is passed without need for specification. Making it clear here because of notes in testing.}
}
\value{
A tree of class phylo with summary branch lengths in tree$edge.length.

\description{
conflate: Calculate the conflation of multiple distributions
pdfs, plot = TRUE, from, to, n, add = FALSE
}
\details{
Produces either a plot or a data frame
with the x and y values for the conflated PDF. It uses as input
a vector of densities constructed with
density_fun, and further parameters to be pased to curve
if no plot is desired these are still used for returning
a data frame with the x and y values from evaluation the
conflated PDF on the sequence of x values determined by
a number n of equidistant points between from and to.

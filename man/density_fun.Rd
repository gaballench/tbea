\title{density_fun: A way to represent distributions to be conflated}
\usage{
density_fun(x, dist, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a symbol which needs to be present in order to allow passing values towards the distruibution generator. It should be just x, without quotation marks (see examples).}

\item{dist}{A character (using single quotes!) with the name of the distribution to use.}

\item{...}{Parameters to be passed on to dist. See examples}
}
\value{
A call from the elements of the distribution to be used.
}
\description{
density_fun: A way to represent distributions to be conflated
}
\details{
Produces a definition of each individual distribution to be conflated
and provides the symbol for non-standard evaluation (x). Single quotes in dist
are mandatory in order to avoid issues when calling expressions under the hood.
See the documentation for each individual distribution to call their parameters
adequately. Argument names and values should be used.
